# Dendrite Arborization Tracer

Coming soon... Please come back later.

Dendrite Arborization Tracer is a tool to segment neurons along with their dendrites. It takes a single channel image as input. 

- The neuron and its cell body are detected by thresholding. 
- The neuron is skeletonized, only in the masked area, using the watershed algotrithm.
- The skeletonized neuron is further segmented to identify dendrites.
